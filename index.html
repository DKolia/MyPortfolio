        <h3>fineGrind - Find the Perfect Gind</h3>
        <p>fineGrind builds off of the popular gig-economy idea, providing users the ability to search for jobs nearby to see what needs being done- including bartending, automotive, or other types of popular side jobs.</p>
        <p>Users may browse nearby jobs, or register themselves a free account to ask for a helping hand. Each job only lasts in our database for only 48 hours, meaning any grinds you find will be actionable and relevant.</p>
        <p>Myself and Badal Moradia build fineGrind using one of the world's favorite APIs, Google Maps, along with Node.Js, Express, and more.

        <h3>These Kings - History Trivia from Mesopotamia</h3>
        <p>Introducing These Kings, a trivia game not based on Romans, Greeks, or Egyptian leaders, but rather the often overlooked Assyrian Kings. This challenging game built using JQuery will introduce you to several Kings from the Assyrian Empire, but stay sharp as each game will introduce new Kings, and remove old ones.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I built These Kings to demonstrate my ability with JQuery and functional Javascript.</p>

        <h3>WhatAbout - List Your Social Media Easily</h3>
        <p>Be the social butterfly you'd like to be, by listing your favorite social media on this handy app. Instead of linking to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and LinkedIn one-by-one, WhatAbout gives you the ability to list them with clarity and ease.</p>
        <p>Better yet, should you prefer one site or app over another, you can easily unplug from one, without fear of missing out as your friends will still be able to find you on your preferred platforms.</p>

        <h3>Drzzl - The Rain Lover's Weather App</h3>
        <p>Enjoy the pleasant pitter-patter of a gentle rain. <em>Us too!</em> Drzzl is a simple but charming web app that tells you localized weather and percipitation. It also features several rainy-day photos from around the world courtesy of a Reddit API and allows users to sign in to upload their own!</p>
