      <h2>A Designing Developer that Does</h2>

      <p>Hello! I am David Kolia- a web developer with a photographer and design background based out of Chicago's historic Rogers Park. I enjoy learning how things are built, pondering on how to make them better, and staying organized while making them happen.</p>

      <p>My functional and accessible web designs stems from my years of graphic design and analog prepress skills. Thoughtful layout, composition, and design come from years of composing through the viewfinder of my film and digital SLR cameras.</p>

      <p>I've graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Intensive and earned my Bachelor's Degree from the Illinois Institute of Art. Both programs taught me not only how to learn, but how to take the ideas in my head and make them a reality. Whether working on a team or solo, I'm known for having fun while helping make big things happen.</p>

      <p>When I am not developing, I am interested in product design, home decor, gaming, and minimalism. I also take care of my 30+ exotic and tropical house plants.</p>

      <p>Please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. I can't wait to meet you.</p>

      <p>- David</p>
