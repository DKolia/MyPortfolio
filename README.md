# MyPortfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio. This is an ongoing project where I share with the world what I am currently creating and who I am.

It is exciting to be a developer and to create something beautiful from (literally) virtually nothing. It is also quite exciting for me to be the person to solve problems, introduce new products, or build new and exciting projects with new team members.

Although I am just getting started on my journey, I am excited to learn and immerse myself in new technology and to be a part of a team.

Please feel free to add me on GitHub, LinkedIn, or simply email me with any questions. Thank you.
